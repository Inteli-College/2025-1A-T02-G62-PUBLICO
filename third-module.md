Project Overview

Nexos is a global financial platform built to empower Latin American businesses operating across borders. It enables companies to send, receive, and manage money internationally with the same simplicity as a local transaction — all powered by blockchain-based financial infrastructure.

By leveraging stablecoins as financial rails, Nexos provides a faster, more transparent, and independent way for businesses to operate globally — without the friction of traditional banking systems.

Our mission is bold: to become the first international on-chain bank, bridging traditional finance and digital assets with full regulatory compliance.

What We've Built

Since launch, Nexos has delivered key features that form the foundation of a modern financial operating system for LATAM businesses:

PIX receiving with automatic exchange to stablecoins (USD).

US domestic transfers via nominated virtual accounts.

Corporate USD accounts with zero IOF — offering up to 3.5% better FX rates than traditional banks.

Affiliate seller commission program.

Internal ledger to manage balances and transaction records.

Automated KYC/KYB with leading compliance partners.

These components combine to deliver a global account experience that feels local, fast, and compliant.

Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Backend	Python + FastAPI (asynchronous API layer)
Database	PostgreSQL (structured SQL control)
Frontend	Next.js + React

Our backend manages financial logic, compliance workflows, foreign exchange, and internal reconciliation. The frontend provides a simple, intuitive interface for financial operations.

Security & Compliance

Nexos operates with full regulatory transparency and compliance in both Brazil and the United States.

Recognized as a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) in Brazil, based on a legal opinion from Pinheiro Neto Advogados.

Entity established in the U.S., currently in the process of becoming a registered MSB (Money Services Business) under FinCEN.

End-to-end KYC/KYB automation through global compliance partners.

Operations aligned with Banco Central and FinCEN requirements, ensuring safety, transparency, and legal robustness for all clients.

Strategic Vision

Nexos is building the financial core for a new generation of global companies. Our infrastructure connects stablecoin rails, local payment networks, and multi-currency liquidity — creating a unified cross-border experience.

Recent and ongoing milestones include:

EURO account in progress, extending our multi-currency capabilities.

Integration with a BRL stablecoin issuer — enabling seamless fiat-crypto interoperability (product coming soon).

Investment round closed with Latitud, Caravela, and LASP Capital, reinforcing our growth and regulatory expansion strategy.
