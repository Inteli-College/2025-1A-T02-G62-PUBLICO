# **Business Model – Nexos**
## **1. Introduction**
The increasing globalization of companies and the digitization of financial services have exposed significant limitations in traditional banking infrastructure. Cross-border payments remain slow, expensive, and operationally complex, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and globally distributed companies.
Nexos is a financial technology platform designed to provide global banking services for companies, enabling them to hold, move, and exchange money across jurisdictions in an efficient, transparent, and scalable manner. The platform abstracts complex settlement technologies while offering a user experience comparable to traditional corporate banking.
