Project Overview
Our project aims to develop an AI-powered assistant designed to support self-employed professionals in managing their client interactions more efficiently. The assistant will integrate with widely used messaging platforms, particularly WhatsApp, to streamline tasks such as service scheduling, payment processing, and information sharing.

Progress Summary
During the first quarter, we focused on foundational work that will shape the development and implementation of the solution:

Market Research

Conducted extensive research to understand the needs and pain points of self-employed professionals in different sectors.

Identified several existing solutions in the market, which helped us evaluate potential gaps and refine our value proposition.

Mapped out key features that would differentiate our product from current alternatives.

Technical Planning & Development

Began structuring the database to support client records, service scheduling, communication logs, and payment tracking.

Designed the initial message flow to ensure intuitive and responsive interaction between the assistant and users.

Established plans for integrating with WhatsApp through official APIs to ensure secure and scalable communication.

Next Steps
Finalize the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) feature set based on user feedback and competitive analysis.

Develop the backend architecture and implement key database features.

Begin testing early prototypes of the assistant with a select group of users.
