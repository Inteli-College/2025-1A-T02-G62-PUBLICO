## üåê Project Overview

*Nexos* is a financial infrastructure platform designed to serve Latin American (LATAM) businesses operating globally. The platform enables companies to send, receive, and manage money across borders efficiently‚Äîwithout relying on traditional banking systems.

To achieve this, Nexos uses *stablecoins as financial rails*, allowing for fast, transparent, and independent cross-border transactions. This architecture reduces friction, improves liquidity, and lowers costs for LATAM-based businesses.

## üí° What We've Built

Since launch, Nexos has already delivered several core financial features:

* ‚úÖ *PIX receiving with automatic exchange to stablecoins (USD).*
* ‚úÖ *US domestic transfers via nominated virtual accounts.*
* ‚úÖ *Affiliate seller commission program.*
* ‚úÖ *Internal ledger to manage balances and transactional records.*

These components form the backbone of a new financial operating system for small to mid-sized businesses in the region.

## üß± Tech Stack

The platform was built with modern, high-performance technologies:

| Layer    | Technology                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Backend  | Python + FastAPI (asynchronous API layer)  |
| Database | PostgreSQL (SQL queries with high control) |
| Frontend | Next.js + React |
| Hosting  | AWS cloud services (e.g., Lambda, RDS, S3) |

The backend handles financial logic, compliance workflows, currency conversion, and internal reconciliation, while the frontend delivers a clean, responsive experience for business users.

## üöÄ Strategic Vision

Nexos is focused on becoming the financial core for LATAM companies with international operations. The platform's use of *stablecoins, **multi-currency tools, and **automated compliance* gives businesses access to global infrastructure without the usual friction.

Upcoming developments include:

* Multi-currency cards
* Expansion into other LATAM currencies (e.g., ARS, CLP, MXN)
* Direct integrations with stablecoin issuers and payment networks
* Regulatory licensing in Brazil and the U.S.
